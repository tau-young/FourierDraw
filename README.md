# FourierDraw

Draw a picture using a Fourier Transformation.

## Usage

Enter an SVG file address, the pair of epicycloids and tolerance or just use the default option.

Drawing progress will automatically begin whenever an entry loses focus or "return" button is hit on your keyboard.

## Known issues

As number of epicycloids grew, the picture is more percise to the original one, but the end will crowd a lot pf arrows and circles, so it may look like a huge mess.

The tolerance determines how many points are taken from one path, so if it is large or path is too long, the result may appear like dotted curves. I will fix that in the fiture version.

The speed of the drawing is completely decided by your machine's performance, as I added no sleep to the code.

The best size of the original image is 550x400, too large or small image may not be up to your expectation. I will add scale funtion in the furure to accept more images.

**Have fun!**
